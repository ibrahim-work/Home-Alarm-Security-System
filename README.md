# Home-Alarm-Security-System
Object oriented programming project which consists of a home/business style security and alarm system using the Arduino Uno Grove Board interface. I access the different buttons, inputs, outputs, LEDs, buzzers, and sensors of this board using Java firmata4j libraries to make a fully functional alarm system that can be engaged by the user.
